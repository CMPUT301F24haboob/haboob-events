# Git Workflow Instructions

## Preamble

If you don't have a lot of experience with git (or even if you do), do yourself a favour and download GitHub Desktop here: https://desktop.github.com/download/

It makes using git way easier, especially when you are contantly branching and making pull requests. If you need a tutorial on it let me(Dan) know.

You can also use the source control extension in VS Code for easy commits/pushes. Or just use terminal if you're a freak.

## General Flow

We will have a branch off main called **dev**. We will ONLY directly branch of of dev to develop feature. I will call these branches off dev **feature branches**. Once a feature is complete, you will test it and then create a pull request to merge your branch with **dev**. Once we hit specific milestones, we can test the dev branch thoroughly and then merge it with main. Main should always contain a working version of our app with no KNOWN bugs (bugs will always exist but you shouldn't knowing push buggy code).

See below for detailed instructions on the workflow

## Setp-by-Step Instructions

1. Make sure you are on the **dev** branch. If you are using terminal, runt his command: `git checkout dev`
   Then run `git status` and make sure it says you are on the branch dev.
   If you are on github desktop, simply select the dev branch as your current branch
